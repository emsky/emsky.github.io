<hr />

<p>In October 2016, I joined ePLDT’s Experience Creation Team and PLDT’s Disruptive Business Group.</p>

<p>During the two years, I helped the team define its very own process and launched multiple experiments on the AARRR funnels of the company’s products and solutions. I helped ePLDT tackle tough challenges such as designing customer and employee experiences, bridging the gap between user experience and data security and establishing design strategies for cross-functional teams.</p>

<p>This experience helped me learn new design methodologies and strategy frameworks which refined my overall comprehension of user experience and product design for the digital medium.</p>
