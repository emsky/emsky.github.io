<hr />

<p>In mid-2018, I helped PLDT Enterprise envision an innovative experience using chatbots, augmented reality and gamification for its 4th annual Philippine Digital Convention, which connected local business leaders with global visionaries and pioneers in technology.</p>

<p>Having previously designed the 2017 version of the app, I used insights from year&#8217;s performance to refine our target personas and define this year’s MVP. As its principal designer, I was actively engaged on both the discovery and delivery stages of the app. I worked on the visual design, handled the microcopy, prototyped possible features and personally conducted hallway tests.</p>

<p>With this experience, I had the opportunity to fine-tune my process to work with a dual-track product development framework and to work with a creative team outside of my own.</p>
