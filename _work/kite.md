Branching out of my lead front-end developer role, in mid 2015, I helped Kite Systems and its sister companies, Kite Media and MagneticAsia, create a companion app for HongKong’s Premier Music & Arts Festival.

I worked to design the interface and augment the ticketing mechanics for the festival into the iOS and Android app. Successfully integrating both system was a key milestone to expanding Ticketflap to offer its services to other events and organizers.
