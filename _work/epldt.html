description: &gt;
We sat down with stakeholders and learned that management teams may not be aware of the strategic value of design, and do not use it as a resource for innovation. Our mission was clear: culture change&mdash;</p>

<p>Goal #1: Provide design leadership to the designers and developers across teams to help streamline design output and centralize resources
insightleftdesc: |
We wanted teams to break out of their silos and bond through collaboration and good critique. We needed to guide and upskill cross-functional teams to follow best user experience practices and to achieve operational excellence and rapid digital transformation.

Goal #2: Act as a strategic partner, helping manage the digital roadmap for the product, applications development, and marketing teams
insightmiddesc: |
To ensure digital presences and channels that are focused around the needs of users, we had to carry out comprehensive user-centered design and business projects. We needed to have the voice of the user present in every roadmapping session.

Goal #3: Open new digital channels gearshifted towards lead generation, client acquisition, customer retention and data privacy.

&#8220;The future of the DigiCon 2018 Event Mobile Application contains more interactivity and is heavily activity-based. Chatbots, gamification, AR and beacon technology are interesting areas we desired to explore and offer.&#8221;</p></li>

<hr />

<p>In October 2016, I joined ePLDT’s Experience Creation Team and PLDT’s Disruptive Business Group.</p>

<p>During the two years, I helped the team define its very own process and launched multiple experiments on the AARRR funnels of the company’s products and solutions. I helped ePLDT tackle tough challenges such as designing customer and employee experiences, bridging the gap between user experience and data security and establishing design strategies for cross-functional teams.</p>

<p>This experience helped me learn new design methodologies and strategy frameworks which refined my overall comprehension of user experience and product design for the digital medium.</p>
