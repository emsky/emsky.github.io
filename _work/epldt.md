In October 2016, I joined ePLDT’s Experience Creation Team and PLDT’s Disruptive Business Group.

During the two years, I helped the team define its very own process and launched multiple experiments on the AARRR funnels of the company’s products and solutions. I helped ePLDT tackle tough challenges such as designing customer and employee experiences, bridging the gap between user experience and data security and establishing design strategies for cross-functional teams.

This experience helped me learn new design methodologies and strategy frameworks which refined my overall comprehension of user experience and product design for the digital medium.
