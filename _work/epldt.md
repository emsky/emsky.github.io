      We sat down with stakeholders and learned that management teams may not be aware of the strategic value of design, and do not use it as a resource for innovation. Our mission was clear: culture change&mdash;
    insightlefttitle: |
      Goal #1: Provide design leadership to the designers and developers across teams to help streamline design output and centralize resources
    insightleftdesc: |
      We wanted teams to break out of their silos and bond through collaboration and good critique. We needed to guide and upskill cross-functional teams to follow best user experience practices and to achieve operational excellence and rapid digital transformation.
    insightmidtitle: |
      Goal #2: Act as a strategic partner, helping manage the digital roadmap for the product, applications development, and marketing teams
    insightmiddesc: |
      To ensure digital presences and channels that are focused around the needs of users, we needed to have the voice of the user present in every roadmapping session.
    insightrighttitle: |
      Goal #3: Open new digital channels gearshifted towards lead generation, client acquisition, customer retention and data privacy.
    insightrightdesc: |
      We needed to drive through major changes to the way the Experience Creation team works, while delivering a roadmap of user-centered design and business projects that we’re proud to be part of.

      Culture change isn't a walk in the park. We had to go about it one project at a time, iterating on our process along the way. But first, we needed to know where we stood in the grand scheme of things.

    heading: Define growth opportunities
    description: |
      It's capital for the team to understand the current state of things before thinking of any solutions. We ran a series of workshops with senior and executive stakeholders to establish business objectives, strategies and measures of success. Where did we want to be at the end of the year? Where did we see ePLDT in 5 years?

    heading: Every race needs a starting line
    description: |
      We needed to benchmark how far we need to go and determine what it takes to get there. Inspired by Nielsen-Norman's model, I devised a framework for measuring the UX maturity of the organization. This helped us identify areas of opportunities where UX and design can deliver the most value.

    heading: A user-centric approach

      I worked alongside cross-functional teams to create a user-centric innovation pipeline and support roadmaps of tactical projects, all with users in mind. I also help introduce and execute design sprints in collaboration with marketing, business, sales and product teams.

    heading: Designing the experiments
    description: |
      The envisioning phases for each project played a big role to generate experiment ideas that focus on solving the user’s pain points and not mindlessly attempt to drive growth. Nonetheless, to capture the essence of the proposed solutions and reaffirmed their potential, it is important to phrase the experiments as hypotheses.

      Good hypotheses ensure better design quality by framing the user experience around the success metrics while grounding the decisions in facts and data.

    heading: Personas that evolve
    description: |
      ePLDT offers a wide range of solutions and services, and it goes without saying that each targets a different set of personas. In lieu of traditional personas, we went with the JTBD (jobs-to-be-done) framework.

      Starting with provisionals derived from guerilla research, we evolved these personas as we developed the solutions. A mature persona added more business and design value to us so I devised a gamified persona development process to help us quantify the maturity level of each persona, using data from that to support other projects. Pretty neat, actually.

    heading: Running usability tests at scale
    description: |
      Because we needed to make sure that our visual strategies successfully conveyed the company's brand pillars, I develop strategies and programs, not just for usability testing and evaluation, but also for measuring brand desirability. I based the desirability framework on the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit, using key words that fit ePLDT's brand messaging.

      Consistent designs meant a stronger brand. Collaborating closely with cross-departmental design teams, I helped develop ePLDT’s style guide, culture code and design system, and maintained centralized libraries to improve consistency of design across projects. One of our goals was to improve productivity and efficiency among design teams by providing a single source of truth for all things design-related within the organization.

      Working in ePLDT's Experience Creation team has been a huge contributor to my product design education. In two years, I have learned new processes and refined my overall comprehension of  design for the digital medium.

      As I push forward to new frontiers, I believe that the use of hypotheses, experimentations, success metrics and fast idea generation are important principles and techniques that can be applied anywhere.

In October 2016, I joined ePLDT’s Experience Creation Team and PLDT’s Disruptive Business Group. During the two years, I helped the team define its very own process and launched multiple experiments on the AARRR funnels of the company’s products and solutions, and helped ePLDT tackle tough challenges such as designing customer and employee experiences, bridging the gap between user experience and data security and establishing design strategies for cross-functional teams.

This experience helped me learn new design methodologies and strategy frameworks which refined my overall comprehension of user experience and product design for the digital medium.
