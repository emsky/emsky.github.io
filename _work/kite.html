<hr />

<p>In mid 2014, I joined Kite Systems as the lead front-end developer for NAVGlobal, a wealth and finance management app. My goal was to style for a crossover between ASP and .Net. Collaborating with an international front-end team of three, I helped Kite establish its front-end development guidelines and establish a design system.</p>

<p>Branching out of my lead front-end developer role, in mid 2015, I helped Kite Systems and its sister companies, Kite Media and MagneticAsia, create a companion app for HongKong’s Premier Music &amp; Arts Festival, where I worked to design the interface and augment ticketing mechanics on the iOS and Android versions of the app.</p>
