This site is a showcase of the work and projects that I&#8217;ve done over the years, and also serves as a jump-off point for my musings and reflections.</p>

<p>This latest incarnation (the 4th) is the result of flexing my creative and technical ego, taking a break from client and corporate work, and geeking out over a month.</p></li>

<i class="em-svg em-gear"></i> So what makes this site tick?

I built this website on top of <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static site compiler powered by the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> templating engine. Itâ€™s hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I love Jekyll in that it works for both small-scale websites to large-scale layouts without much bloat. It works with or without a database, and it has a very large userbase. Inspired by the <a href="https://medium.com/tmw-interactive/creating-dynamic-layouts-with-jekyll-3bbb7fc57d1f">team behind Canon&#8217;s 2017 re-design</a>, I use Jekyll to make quick prototypes.</p>

<p>What else is good about Jekyll? Well, there are plenty of cloud-based CMS such as <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/">CloudCannon</a> or <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> for those who don&#8217;t wish to deep-dive into coding to update Jekyll websites. What&#8217;s more, my clients love them!</p>

<p>I handcoded my own template and static database myself. You can find the source on Github: <a href="https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io">https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io</a></p></li>

Staying true to my process, I disrupted my own UI workflow by using Adobe Comp &amp; my iPad to create the low-fi wireframes instead of sketching them out on my <a href="https://getrocketbook.com">Rocketbook</a>, and converting them using Sketch. With this new workflow, I was able to combine the sketching and wireframing steps into on step and cut down the ideation time significantly.</p></p></li>

I used <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for my CSS workflow, and derived my boilerplate from <a href="https://milligram.io/">Milligram</a>, a very simple responsive framework that uses Flexbox.</p>

<p>To breathe life into some of the elements, I used <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap">Greensock</a>. Being a big fan of cell-shaded animation, I used the sprite animations to tween some of the major transitions on this website, like the menu button at the top.</p></li>

Github user <a href="https://github.com/afeld/emoji-css">Afeld</a> provides a nice, lightweight API and CSS for embedding emojis (in SVG format, no less!) into any website. He&#8217;s got a very <a href="https://api.afeld.me/">clever personal website</a> too; you should check it out!</p></li>

<i class="em-svg em-pray"></i> A little tribute #TimeForSomeHistory
description: |
Chromatic fonts are the next big thing in visual design. A &#8220;key evolution in digital typography&#8221;, they are an offshoot of open-type SVG font formats initially designed by Mozilla and Adobe. In 2016, they became an industry standard and big players, such as Microsoft and Google agreed on a single format to support chromatic fonts.</p>

<p>The typeface I used to create the &#8220;ellesa&#8221; animation in my About page is called <a href="https://www.typewithpride.com/">Gilbert Sans</a>. Having grown up with my gay best friends, I witnessed their struggles and adventures through a world that wasn&#8217;t prepared for them yet, and this is sort of my tribute to how far they&#8217;ve come.</p></li>
