This site is a showcase of the work and projects that I&#8217;ve done over the years, and also serves as a jump off point for my musings and reflections.</p>

<p>This latest incarnation (the 4th) is the result of flexing my creative and technical ego, taking a break from client and corporate work, and geeking out over a month.</p></li>

I built this website on top of <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static site compiler powered by the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> templating engine. Itâ€™s hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>I handcoded the template and static database myself. You can find find the source on Github: <a href="https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io">https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io</a></p></li>

Staying true to my process, I disrupted my own UI workflow by using Adobe Comp to create the low-fi wireframes instead of sketching them out on my <a href="https://getrocketbook.com">Rocketbook</a>, and converting them using Sketch.</p>

<p>With Adobe Comp on my iPad Pro, I was able to combine the sketching and wireframing steps into one. I hope I can use this in future projects!</p></li>
