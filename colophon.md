    This site is a showcase of the work and projects that I've done over the years, and also serves as a jump-off point for my musings and reflections.

    This latest incarnation (the 4th) is the result of flexing my creative and technical ego, taking a break from client and corporate work, and geeking out over a month.

    I built this website on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site compiler  powered by the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating engine. Itâ€™s hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I love Jekyll in that it works for both small-scale websites to large-scale layouts without much bloat. It works with or without a database, and it has a very large userbase. Inspired by the [team behind Canon's 2017 re-design](https://medium.com/tmw-interactive/creating-dynamic-layouts-with-jekyll-3bbb7fc57d1f), I use Jekyll to make quick prototypes.

    What else is good about Jekyll? Well, there are plenty of cloud-based CMS such as [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) or [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) for those who don't wish to deep-dive into coding to update Jekyll websites. What's more, my clients love them!

    I handcoded my own template and static database myself. You can find the source on Github: [https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io](https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io)

    Staying true to my process, I disrupted my own UI workflow by using Adobe Comp & my iPad to create the low-fi wireframes instead of sketching them out on my [Rocketbook](https://getrocketbook.com), and converting them using Sketch. With this new workflow, I was able to combine the sketching and wireframing steps into on step and cut down the ideation time significantly.

    I used [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for my CSS workflow, and derived my boilerplate from [Milligram](https://milligram.io/), a very simple responsive framework that uses Flexbox.

    To breathe life into some of the elements, I used [Greensock](https://greensock.com/gsap). Being a big fan of cell-shaded animation, I used the sprite animations to tween some of the major transitions on this website, like the menu button at the top.

    Github user [Afeld](https://github.com/afeld/emoji-css) provides a nice, lightweight API and CSS for embedding emojis (in SVG format, no less!) into any website. He's got a very [clever personal website](https://api.afeld.me/) too; you should check it out!

  description: |
    Chromatic fonts are the next big thing in visual design. A "key evolution in digital typography", they are an offshoot of open-type SVG font formats initially designed by Mozilla and Adobe. In 2016, they became an industry standard and big players, such as Microsoft and Google agreed on a single format to support chromatic fonts.

    The typeface I used to create the "ellesa" animation in my About page is called [Gilbert Sans](https://www.typewithpride.com/). Having grown up with my gay best friends, I witnessed their struggles and adventures through a world that wasn't prepared for them yet, and this is sort of my tribute to how far they've come.
