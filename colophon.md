    This site is a showcase of the work and projects that I've done over the years, and also serves as a jump off point for my musings and reflections.

    This latest incarnation (the 4th) is the result of flexing my creative and technical ego, taking a break from client and corporate work, and geeking out over a month.

    I built this website on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site compiler  powered by the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating engine. Itâ€™s hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

    I handcoded the template and static database myself. You can find find the source on Github: [https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io](https://github.com/emsky/emsky.github.io)

    Staying true to my process, I disrupted my own UI workflow by using Adobe Comp to create the low-fi wireframes instead of sketching them out on my [Rocketbook](https://getrocketbook.com), and converting them using Sketch.

    With Adobe Comp on my iPad Pro, I was able to combine the sketching and wireframing steps into one. I hope I can use this in future projects!
