<hr />

<p>I joined the Nimbyx team in Nov 2015 to work on the company&#8217;s flagship solutions: Evident Labs and Nimbyx.</p>

<p>The legacy Evident Labs software, with a userbase of 10 million patients and 110,000 dentists, was in need of a crossover into .Net, as well as a major experience design.</p>

<p>Nimbyx is a marketplace for dental products that comes with three modules Ship, Shop and Rewards. The systems were designed around several integrations including Stripe for billing, and FedEx and UPS for shipping.</p>

<p>I took charge of designing and developing the style guide and CSS frameworks. To save hours of development time, I worked closely with clients to rapidly iterate on UI solutions. I handled research, wireframing, prototyping, high-fidelity mockups and user flows.</p>

<p>The experience gave me the opportunity to work with a dedicated design team and helped me fine-tune my own UI workflow and UX approach.</p>
