In early 2011, I helped John Scott to re-think the way voice lessons were done. I worked closely with John and his voice coaches to create a digital experience that emulates an actual music school. Unprecedented, this project allowed us to break new ground in music, and to make John's lessons accessible to a global audience.

I had the chance to own the design and product vision from core concept to visual design to the first release of the PHP-based web platform, as well as its iOS and Android app. I also helped re-design the JDS website and its blog.
